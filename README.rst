Open3D and PCL Comparison
=========================

Who's using Open3D in the ROS community
---------------------------------------

There is a `rosdep key python3-open3d-pip <https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/d208d0b7fee8dcf2cad4d540fc055d9d9be3b6a8/rosdep/python.yaml#L2988>`_ added in `ros/rosdistro#28352 <https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/28352>`_.
This kind of key cannot be used by released packages, so its presence suggests someone is using it in an unreleased ROS package.

There is a ``perception_open3d`` repository that is released into Melodic and Noetic (ROS 1) `ros-perception/perception_open3d <https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_open3d>`_ that was originally available at `ntnu-arl/open3d_ros <https://github.com/ntnu-arl/open3d_ros>`_.
There is a `ROS World 2020 Lightning talk about it <https://vimeo.com/480560723>`_.
The package depends on Open3d, but does not list a rosdep key in its ``package.xml``.
Instead it documents that Open3D must be installed manually.
The repo provides a conversions package and an examples package.
It has conversions from ``open3d::t::geometry::PointCloud`` and ``open3d::geometry::PointCloud`` to/from ``sensor_msgs::PointCloud2``.
There `is a foxy-devel branch <https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_open3d/tree/foxy-devel/open3d_conversions>`_ with conversions from ``open3d::geometry::PointCloud`` to/from ``sensor_msgs::PointCloud2``, but it has not been released.

An improvement here would be to create rosdep keys for ``libopen3d-dev``, ``python3-open3d`` and ``libopen3d0d``.
These packages won't be available for use in Rolling until the next LTS release of Ubuntu.
The version in Debian upstream is 0.9.0. Some time spent updating the version in Debian may be a good idea before Ubuntu branches off of it.

* https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libopen3d-dev
* https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libopen3d0d
* https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/python3-open3d
* https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/libopen3d-dev
* https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/python3-open3d
* https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/libopen3d0d

There is a Python package for converting Open3D types to PointCloud messages (ROS Melodic only?) `SeungBack/open3d-ros-helper <https://github.com/SeungBack/open3d-ros-helper>`_.


Can I pass Python datastructures to C++ and back?
-------------------------------------------------

This question is answered in the ``cpp_py`` folder.

* Open3d - Yes, at least when using ``open3d::geometry::PointCloud`` and Pybind11
* PCL - No official Python bindings exist, but there are some unofficial ones
    * `strawlab/python-pcl <https://github.com/strawlab/python-pcl/issues/395>`_ is popular but unmaintained and uses cython
    * `davidcaron/pclpy <https://github.com/davidcaron/pclpy>`_ is another that uses Pybind11
        *  Also seems unmaintained, I could not try it on 20.04 because of this bug https://github.com/davidcaron/pclpy/issues/91
